      <description>Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Sam. I&amp;rsquo;m a theme for Hugo. I&amp;rsquo;m an extremely customizable, content-focused theme that lets you showcase your work your way.
I have slick minimalist templates for list pages (such as a list of blog posts) and single pages (a page to read one blog post). You can use tags on your content, and view content by tags.
I also have a simple responsive gallery built with CSS grid. It&amp;rsquo;ll look great on any screen, and all you have to do is provide a folder of images.</description>

      <description>Demon Sword Maiden revolves around a boy who was sent to a dark, mysterious parallel world in the body of his beautiful senior sister, Lily. The lone girl ran into the night parade of a hundred demons the very day she arrived; seeking survival amongst the warriorâ€™s dispute in a chaotic world, and forging her own demon sword! This is an unimaginable other world adventure!</description>
